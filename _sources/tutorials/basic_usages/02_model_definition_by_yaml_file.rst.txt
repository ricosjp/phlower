Model Definition by Yaml file
----------------------------------------------------

Phlower offers a way to define models and its order by yaml file.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 14-19

First of all, we would like to load sample yaml data. Please download sample sample yaml.
`data.yml
<https://github.com/ricosjp/phlower/tutorials/basic_usages/sample_data/model/model.yml>`_

we construct PhlowerSetting object from yaml file.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 19-25

.. code-block:: Python


    from phlower.settings import PhlowerSetting

    setting = PhlowerSetting.read_yaml("sample_data/model/model.yml")









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 26-28

Order of models must be DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).
To check such conditions, we call `resolve` function.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 28-32

.. code-block:: Python


    setting.model.network.resolve(is_first=True)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 33-37

In phlower, networks are packed into PhlowerGroupModule.
PhlowerGroupModule is directly created from model setting.

`draw` function generate a file following to mermaid format.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 37-44

.. code-block:: Python


    from phlower.nn import PhlowerGroupModule

    model = PhlowerGroupModule.from_setting(setting.model.network)
    model.draw("images")









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 45-51

The output mermaid file is shown below.

.. mermaid:: ../../tutorials/basic_usages/images/SAMPLE_MODEL.mmd

According to this image, we can understand details of each model and data flow.
